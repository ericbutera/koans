Learn Ruby
==========
http://rubykoans.com/


Set up
======
- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [wsl: ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- ubuntu packages 
    - build-essential ruby ruby-dev
- ruby gems
    - ruby-debug-ide

Should be good to go!

Docker
======
There is a docker branch which has some attempts at getting docker-compose + debug working. I can build containers, but the debugger won't attach. The resources I found are geared towards rails, not vanilla ruby.
